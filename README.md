Small area estimation (SAE) is a branch of sampling theory that producees estimates and measures of 
uncertainty for small subpopulations in a larger study area. Much of the SAE literature is written for a technical
audience. `SAE_viewer` is a small interactive Javascript visualization that [will eventually] illustrate the core
principles of SAE.
