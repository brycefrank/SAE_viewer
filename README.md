Sampling Viewer is a small educational visualization intended to introduce concepts of finite population sampling
and inference in an intuitive and accessible fashion suitable for undergraduate courses. 
We especially focus on sampling in a spatial context.

Sampling Viewer addresses the following concepts:

- Point Estimates
- Standard Error
- Confidence Intervals
- Bias
- Efficiency
