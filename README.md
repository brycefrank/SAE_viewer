Small area estimation (SAE) is a branch of sampling theory that produces estimates and measures of 
uncertainty for small subpopulations in a larger study area. Much of the SAE literature is written for specialists in the field. 
`SAE_viewer` is a small interactive Javascript visualization that communicates the principles of SAE in an intuitive
and accessible fashion.
